### Getting Started

#### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

For a quick and easy setup, we recommend using Docker. This method streamlines the installation process and ensures all dependencies are correctly configured.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hexlorddev/playpulse-panel.git
    cd playpulse-panel
    ```

2.  **Configure environment:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Edit the `.env` file with your specific settings. This file contains crucial configuration variables for your Playpulse Panel instance.

3.  **Launch with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This command will build and start all necessary services in detached mode.

4.  **Initialize the application:**

    ```bash
    docker exec -it playpulse-panel php artisan key:generate
    docker exec -it playpulse-panel php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

    These commands generate an application key and run database migrations, populating the database with initial data.

5.  **Access your panel:**

    Once the setup is complete, you can access your Playpulse Panel at `http://localhost` in your web browser.
