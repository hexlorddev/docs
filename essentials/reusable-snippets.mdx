Playpulse Panel provides advanced user management features, including robust role-based access control and comprehensive security measures.

## Role-Based Access Control

Define and manage user roles with granular permissions:

*   **Super Admin:** Full administrative control over the entire panel.
*   **Admin:** Elevated privileges for managing servers and users.
*   **Reseller:** Manage a subset of users and servers, ideal for hosting providers.
*   **User:** Standard user access for managing their own servers.
*   **Sub-user:** Limited access to specific server functions, assigned by a primary user.

## Security Excellence

Ensure the security of your panel and user data with these features:

*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
*   **OAuth Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with popular authentication providers like Google, Discord, and Steam.
*   **JWT Authentication:** Secure API communication using JSON Web Tokens.
*   **Session management:** Monitor and control active user sessions.
